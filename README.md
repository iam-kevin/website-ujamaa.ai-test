## Project information

Below, lies the information on creating the demo site as demonstrated in 
this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/ULO7triZT4KKl4IuFzSw1p/Ujamaa?node-id=36%3A0).

Given that the project is reproduced from scratch from the template provided in the link above, the 
following are what I have considered to be my estimates on how things will be played out in the project.

Estimate scoped time: **48 hours**

## Things to know before you start

Make sure that you have been connected to the internet since some assets (like `fonts`) use the CDN service.
Check out [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

## Getting started

This project is build upon `react-js` which is initiated using the `create-react-app` script.

Scripts are available to make it easy to build and run the site on the computer

After cloning / downloading the project, install the project dependencies with:

```shell script
yarn install
```

If you have the dependencies already, run


```shell script
yarn start

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
