## Ujamaa.ai `completed`

Tasked to recreate the site as shown in this [Figma Composite](https://www.figma.com/file/ULO7triZT4KKl4IuFzSw1p/Ujamaa?node-id=36%3A0).

I was bound only use:
    - [`material-ui`](https://material-ui.com/) library
    - or `raw` HTML / CSS

For this project, I have used both to a certain degree.

NOTE: Make sure that you have been connected to the internet, since I use Google Fonts API.
